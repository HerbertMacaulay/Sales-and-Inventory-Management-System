# Sales-and-Inventory-Management-System
The online sales and inventory management system is designed to help in automating the process of monitoring product stock level, keeping record of sales transactions carried out, generating sales reports and ordering products from suppliers. This system can perform one automated task with the help of a windows service. The system was built with a cms called DotNetNuke.

I have attached the source code of the project as a .rar file together with the sql script.
